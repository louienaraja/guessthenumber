# Guess the Number
Guess the Number is a simple game where the player tries to guess a number between 1 and 20 in as few attempts as possible. The game keeps track of the player's score, which decreases with each incorrect guess, and also records the player's high score.

## Features
Simple interface with clear instructions.
Submit and reset buttons to control the game.
High score tally to keep track of player's progress.
Usage
To play the game, simply enter your guess in the input box and click the "Guess" button. The game will indicate whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct. The score will decrease by 1 for each incorrect guess, and the game ends when the score reaches 0. If you guess the number correctly, the screen turns green and reveals the correct answer. If your score is higher than the previous high score, it will be updated.
